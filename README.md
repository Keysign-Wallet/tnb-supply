Iâ€™m looking to get a clear picture who owns what supply.

What information id like in this report:
I'd like an automated bot that anyone can run
How much supply does the main team own
% amount of the supply
How much supply do project members own
% amount of the supply
How much supply people who claimed tasks own
% amount of the supply
How much do normal members not related to projects own
% amount of the supply
Anyone not on main team or a project
I'd like a spreadsheet of all accounts who own coins if at all possible
Accounts who earned coins via these methods
You must ignore the main distribution wallets in the report since those assets will be burned in the future. I currently only want the assets people have in their wallets.
Include run instructions
