Here, you will learn about how to use all of what thenewboston-js has to offer. If you notice an error or typo, then please create a pull request yourself and we can pull in the changes to save everyone some time.

## Getting Started

Currently, the only way to use the library is to clone the repository and download the files while loading them into your project. We will upload this the library to [npm](https://npmjs.com).
